# QR Code Generator

This Python based app is a QR code generator that takes a link as input and generates a QR code that can be scanned to access that link. This app uses the popular QR code library qrcode to generate the code.

When you open the app, you should see a prompt to enter a URL that will be used to generate the QR code. Once the user enters the URL, the app would use the QR code library to generate the code. 

The generated QR code is saved as an image file on the device.

Overall, this app would be a useful tool for anyone looking to quickly generate a QR code for a link and streamline the process of sharing that link with others.
